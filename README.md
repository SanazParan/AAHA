# Problem Statement
Atlanta is growing rapidly attracting high-end talent from across the US. As the City of Atlanta has been revitalizing, there is also more people wanting to live intown for a variety of reasons.

Builders have been creating high-end housing units to meet this demand and median rent prices have been increasing.  The median housing cost  in Atlanta has increased by 70% since 2000.

The supply of housing available to meet the needs of the low income residents is not sufficient.  Affordable housing is defined as no more than 30% of your available household income. 

Atlanta Mayor Bottoms has made increasing the number of affordable homes a major policy initiative that is intended to provide an affordable housing model for all cities in the United States.  Her plan calls for creating 20,000 new affordable housing units by 2026.   Will this work?!?
